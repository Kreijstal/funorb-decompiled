# Reading Escape Vector

This is the only published Java tree. Reviewed rules and the reproducer live in dekobloko-work/readable. The current reverse dictionary is ../../decompilation/escapevector-naming.json.

This pass names 23 reviewed classes and 328 symbols across all 348 sources. Unresolved roles keep their existing names; reviewed names have no opaque suffix.

## Entry points

`EscapeVector.updateClient` services input, audio, menus and the active session. `renderClient` calls `renderFrame`, which chooses dialogue, gameplay or another screen. `IntValueNode.startSelectedLevel` constructs `BoundedRandomAccessFile.activeSession` and calls `GameplaySession.startSession`. These unrelated static helpers remain on their original owners because the original client scatters globals across classes.

`GameplaySession.updateSession` contains ship physics, terrain collision, object interactions, mission state and effects. `renderSession` draws the world, HUD and `Minimap`. Ship position/velocity and spawn coordinates have Q16 names: divide by 65536 for pixels. The world wraps horizontally. `levelIndex < 0` selects tutorial behavior. Mission IDs and type codes remain their original integers.

## Terrain and level objects

`loadTerrain` reads `TerrainMap`, installs dimensions/themes/masks and calls `snapshotTerrain`. Each tile is 32 by 32 pixels. Null is empty; `QuickChatPhraseDefinition.fullTileMask` is the shared all-solid identity sentinel, whose array is empty. Partial masks are independently mutable arrays of 32 integer row masks. Four two-bit tile codes occupy each packed byte. `AccountRegistrationPanel.decodeTerrainQuadrants` and `TerrainMaskSupport.decodeTerrainQuadrant` recursively decode partial tiles; their unrelated account/UI globals are retained. Version ten adds a separate secondary theme byte.

`LevelObject` identifies a placed object by objectId/objectType and pixel x/y. Its collision sprite, display sprite and animation frame are distinct. `stampTerrain` ORs nontransparent sprite pixels into collision masks; `removeFromTerrain` clears them, copying a full sentinel before mutation. `initializeLevelObjects` stamps these objects, links gates and constructs the minimap. `buildTutorialTerrain` constructs the tutorial arena directly.

`DynamicTerrainRenderer` is selected for terrain theme four; other themes use the session terrain path. `invalidateTileNeighborhood` marks a 3x3 region dirty following edits. `PointCloudEffect` owns per-point fixed-point motion, masks and drawing. These names do not claim that every effect or object type has been identified.

## Dialogue and shared engine

`DialogueScreen.advanceDialogue` handles reveal timing, input and scene changes; `drawDialogue` draws the current image/text. IntrusiveNode/IntrusiveDeque expose primary ownership and traversal; DualLinkNode has independent secondary links. Sprite/SpriteState separate RGB pixels, trimmed dimensions and offsets. SoftwareRasterizer holds the shared framebuffer and clipping. PacketBuffer and SoundEnvelope expose byte decoding and envelope interpolation.

## Reproduce and verify

From dekobloko-work:

```sh
node readable/build-escapevector-rules.mjs --check
node readable/reproduce-escapevector.mjs --update
node readable/reproduce-escapevector.mjs --check
node scripts/check-source-catalog.mjs ../funorb-decompiled
```

The exact raw input is pinned to Git. Existing generic java-tools declaration and decision proofs run across every file from a verified compiler-source archive, without game assumptions or compiler flags. Each stage is checked for determinism and idempotence, and its hashes/counts are retained in the current dictionary. Naming binds declarations/references/overrides, compiles the complete raw/named corpus and retains reversible edits. No generated sources or binary dependencies are stored in Deko.

Native fixtures compare historical, prepared and named implementations against independent expectations for versioned terrain headers, empty/full/partial masks, sprite collision stamping/removal and deque transfers. The fixed original gamepack also passes the same terrain harness. These focused checks do not prove whole-game behavior, multiplayer compatibility or frame rate. The original mutable obfuscationControl and guard branches remain; unsupported structural recovery and unresolved local names still need review.
